This is example code for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/118809 to show the potential performance benefit to emitting switch statements in loops differently. It is not necessarily well tested / designed / etc., so use it at your own risk - it just does the job it needs to, to demonstrate what I wanted to demonstrate, to run my sample (unoptimised) fibonacci program in a custom-made bytecode interpreter.
